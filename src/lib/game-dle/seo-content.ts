    title: "LoLdle Solver - Find the League of Legends Champion",
    description: "Use our free LoLdle solver to find today's champion. Filter by gender, position, species, resource, range, and release year to narrow the roster.",
    introduction: [
      "Loldle is a daily puzzle where you guess a League of Legends champion using attribute clues. Each guess gives you colored feedback: green for exact matches, yellow for partial matches, and red for wrong attributes. You get six tries per day, and the puzzle resets at midnight UTC.",
      "The challenge comes from League's massive roster — over 170 champions, each with gender, positions, species, regions, and release year to consider. When you guess Ahri and get yellow for species, you know the answer shares at least one species trait. When you guess a 2013 champion and get 'lower' for release year, you've cut the entire modern era.",
      "Type your guess into the solver, set the feedback colors, and watch the champion list shrink. No more keeping mental notes on which positions and regions you've ruled out."
    ],
    howToPlay: [
      { step: "Step 1: Pick a champion you know inside out", description: "Start with your main or a popular pick like Lux or Thresh. You want someone whose position, region, and species you're confident about — guessing wrong on attributes you should know wastes a try." },
      { step: "Step 2: Check each attribute row against the clue", description: "Green means exact match, partial colors mean close, and arrows indicate higher or lower for release year. Pay special attention to the arrows — they're the most informative clue most people underuse." },
      { step: "Step 3: Type your guess into the solver and tap the colors", description: "Click each attribute cell to match what LoLdle shows. The solver only works if your feedback is accurate, so double-check before hitting filter." },
      { step: "Step 4: Look at what's left — pick your next guess strategically", description: "Use the filtered list to pick your next champion. If you know gender and position but not species, guess someone with an uncommon species. Each guess should target an unknown." },
      { step: "Step 5: When you're down to 5 or fewer, go with your gut", description: "The candidate list narrows fast. At that point, commit to the one that feels right based on what you know about recent releases and reworks." }
    ],
    tips: [
      "Start with champions that have unique attribute combinations - champions like Aurelion Sol (unique species) or Bard (unique region) can quickly narrow possibilities if they match.",
      "Pay attention to multi-value attributes like positions and regions - a yellow result here means the answer shares at least one value, which is valuable information.",
      "Use release year strategically - it's one of the few numerical clues. Even if you get a 'higher' or 'lower' arrow, you've eliminated a huge portion of the roster.",
      "For gender clues, remember that female champions are fewer than male champions in LoL, making this attribute particularly useful when you get a match.",
      "Don't ignore the species attribute - League has some truly unique species like Darkin, Void, and Celestial that immediately narrow down possibilities."
    ],
    faqs: [
      { question: "What time does Loldle reset?", answer: "Midnight UTC. If you're on EST, that's 7 PM the night before — so you get the new champion before dinner." },
      { question: "How many champions are in Loldle?", answer: "Over 170 — every playable champion in League. The database gets updated within days of a new champion release." },
      { question: "Can I play Loldle unlimited?", answer: "Yes. Loldle has an unlimited mode for practice. Our solver works for both the daily challenge and unlimited mode." },
      { question: "What do the different colors mean in Loldle?", answer: "Green means the attribute matches exactly. Yellow means partial — used for multi-value attributes like positions where the answer shares at least one value. Red means no match. For numbers, arrows show higher or lower." },
      { question: "Is using a Loldle solver cheating?", answer: "The solver tracks elimination logic you'd otherwise do on paper. You still make every guess — it just filters the list faster. Think of it as a notepad that never forgets." },
      { question: "Why is my guess not showing up?", answer: "Check the spelling. 'Lee Sin' has a space, 'Dr. Mundo' works as both 'Dr. Mundo' and 'Mundo'. The search suggests matches as you type." }
    ],
    strategies: [
      "Use release year like a thermometer: Guess champions from different eras to bracket the timeline. A 2015 champion showing 'higher' tells you the answer is newer — now try a 2020 champion and narrow from there.",
      "Lead with rare attributes: Champions from Bandle City or with unique species (Void, Darkin, Celestial) are rare. If you match on one of these, the candidate list collapses fast.",
      "Nail down positions early: Most champions have 1-2 positions. A green Support match cuts the pool dramatically since Support is a less crowded role.",
      "Species is a sleeper filter: League has humans, yordles, vastaya, Void creatures, and more. A 'no match' on species eliminates a huge chunk of the roster instantly."

    introduction: [
      "Dotadle is a daily Dota 2 hero guessing game. You get six tries to identify the mystery hero, and each guess returns color-coded feedback about attributes like primary attribute, lanes, complexity, and release year. The game covers all 120+ heroes from Dota 2.",
      "Dota heroes have more attributes than most similar games — primary attribute, attack type, lanes, complexity rating, and release year all come into play. Guessing Pudge and getting yellow on lanes means the answer shares at least one lane. Guessing 2013 and getting 'lower' means the hero is older.",
      "Plug your guess and feedback into the solver. It filters the hero pool instantly — no spreadsheet required."
    ],
    howToPlay: [
      { step: "Step 1: Start with a hero whose attributes you're sure about", description: "Pudge, Invoker, or Anti-Mage — someone you've played enough to know their attack type, primary attribute, and range without looking it up." },
      { step: "Step 2: Green means exact, yellow means partial, arrows mean higher/lower", description: "Numeric values like move speed and base armor use arrows. These are gold for narrowing — one 'higher' arrow can cut the pool in half." },
      { step: "Step 3: Log it in the solver to shrink the hero pool", description: "Set each attribute to match what Dotadle showed you. The list updates instantly — you'll see the hero pool drop from 120+ to manageable numbers within 2-3 guesses." },

    tips: [
      "Primary Attribute is your best friend - with only four possible values (Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Universal), getting a green match here eliminates 75% of heroes immediately.",
      "Lane assignments in Dota are more flexible than positions in other games - many heroes can play multiple lanes. A yellow lane result means the answer shares at least one lane with your guess.",
      "Complexity ratings (Easy, Medium, Hard) are often overlooked but can quickly filter the pool. If you get a complexity match, you've eliminated two-thirds of heroes.",
      "Release year clues are powerful but tricky - use heroes from different eras of Dota to triangulate the answer. A hero from 2006 and one from 2020 can help you bracket the timeline.",
      "Species attributes can include surprising categories - Dota's lore encompasses humans, undead, demons, elementals, and more. Even a 'no match' on species eliminates a chunk of possibilities."

      { question: "What's the difference between Dotadle Classic and other modes?", answer: "Classic is the attribute-guessing mode. Other modes may use ability icons, quotes, or visual clues. The solver works best for Classic but the hero database applies to all." },
      { question: "Why do some heroes show multiple lanes?", answer: "Dota heroes are flexible. Spirit Breaker might be listed for Offlane, Support, and Roamer. A partial match on lanes means the answer shares at least one lane position." },
      { question: "How accurate is the complexity rating?", answer: "The ratings come from Valve's official hero classifications — the same ones shown in the Dota 2 client." },

      { step: "Step 2: Type and color matches tell you what's shared", description: "Green means exact. Partial colors mean the answer shares something — maybe the same type or the same color category. Arrows work for height: 'taller' or 'shorter' than your pick." },

      "Type combinations are your most powerful clue - there are only 18 types, and dual types create recognizable patterns. A green Type 1 match plus knowing Type 2 possibilities dramatically narrows options.",
      "Evolution Stage is underutilized - this single attribute divides Pokemon into three clear categories. A match here eliminates 2/3 of the pool instantly.",
      "Habitat information can be decisive - Pokemon habitats are fairly specific, and some habitats have very few Pokemon. A green habitat match might leave you with 10 or fewer candidates.",
      "Use weight and height strategically - these numerical clues often get ignored, but they're fantastic for triangulation. If you know the answer is heavier than Pikachu but lighter than Snorlax, you've bracketed a range.",
      "Color seems cosmetic but matters - Pokemon are officially classified by color, and this can help distinguish between similar species. Charizard is red/orange, Blastoise is blue, etc."
    ],
    faqs: [
      { question: "Which Pokemon generation does Pokedle use?", answer: "Generation 1 — the original 151 Kanto Pokemon. Smaller pool means every clue is more valuable than in games with bigger rosters." },

      { question: "What does 'None' mean for Type 2?", answer: "The Pokemon has only one type. This rules out all dual-typed Pokemon immediately — useful info." },
      { question: "How are Pokemon colors determined?", answer: "From official Pokedex classifications, not visual appearance. Bulbasaur is 'Green' even though it looks blue-ish. These categories are consistent across all Pokemon media." },
      { question: "Can I play Pokedle more than once a day?", answer: "The daily challenge is once per day. Many sites offer unlimited practice modes too — our solver works for both." },
      { question: "Why isn't my Pokemon showing up in search?", answer: "Check the spelling. The solver suggests matches as you type, so click the correct name from the dropdown." }

    strategies: [
      "Maximize type coverage: Start with Pokemon that have unique type combinations. A single green type match narrows to 20-30 Pokemon — both types green almost solves it.",

      "Hunt by habitat: Some habitats have very few Pokemon. 'Rare' habitat is especially tight — a match there narrows fast.",
