                                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-5">What is the Wordle Analyzer?</h2>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                        The Wordle Analyzer is a post-game review tool. You paste a finished game — your guesses and the answer — and it replays every turn, comparing your line against what an AI would have picked with the same information. It tells you how much information each guess revealed and whether it matched the best available option.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                        Unlike a solver that helps you during a live puzzle, the analyzer works after the fact. It has access to the answer, which means it can calculate exactly how many possibilities each guess eliminated and whether a different choice would have been stronger.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                                        The AI line is not a fixed sequence — it recalculates after every one of your guesses using only the information that was available at that point. If you played SLATE and got feedback, the AI line shows what it would have picked next given those same clues.

                                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-5">How the AI Line Is Calculated</h2>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                        After each of your guesses, the analyzer builds the current clue state — which letters are green, yellow, or gray — and evaluates every valid 5-letter word as a potential next guess. For each candidate, it simulates what the clue pattern would look like against the actual answer and calculates how evenly that pattern would split the remaining pool.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                        This is entropy-based solving. A guess that produces many different possible clue patterns — each splitting the remaining candidates into groups of similar size — scores higher than one that mostly produces similar patterns. The AI picks the guess with the highest entropy score, not the one most likely to be correct.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                                        The distinction matters. A guess that is likely to be the answer scores poorly on entropy because it does not reveal much information when it is wrong. A guess that is unlikely to be correct but produces highly informative clue patterns scores high because it eliminates the most candidates regardless of whether it was right.

                                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-5">When Hard Mode Checks Matter</h2>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                        Wordle's hard mode forces every guess to respect confirmed information. Once a letter is green, it must stay in that position for all future guesses. Once a letter is yellow, it must appear somewhere in a future guess. Breaking these rules is not illegal — the game allows it — but it violates hard mode's constraints.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                        The analyzer flags violations even if you eventually solved the puzzle. A common scenario: you get a green letter in position 2, then later in the game you use it in position 4. Technically a valid English word, but it violates the hard mode lock on position 2. The analysis will note this so you know it happened.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                                        Most players accidentally break hard mode at least once per week. The violation is usually minor — swapping a locked letter to a different position — but it means you broke the discipline you committed to. The analyzer keeps you honest.

                                        The AI line optimizes for information gain across all possible answers. It does not care about your specific clue state or whether you are close to solving. It would recommend the same guess whether you have 1 guess left or 6.
                                </p>

                                        This creates situations where the AI and human strategies diverge. In a 2-guess situation with 10 candidates left, the AI recommends the highest-entropy guess. You might instead pick one of the 10 candidates directly — it has 10% chance of being right, and if it is wrong you learn exactly which one it is. This is a valid strategy, but it is not what the AI recommends.
                                </p>

After 10-20 analyzed games, most players develop an intuition for which letter patterns split the pool well — and they stop needing the tool for the hardest decisions.

                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                        Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle, a Brooklyn-based software engineer, and launched in October 2021. The New York Times acquired it in January 2022 for a seven-figure sum after it exploded to millions of daily players. The premise is simple: guess a 5-letter word in 6 tries. After each guess, colored tiles reveal which letters are correct, misplaced, or absent.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                        The game resets at midnight local time. Everyone gets the same word each day, which turned it into a social phenomenon — people share their colored tile grids on Twitter and group chats without revealing the answer. The answer list started at 2,315 words but the NYT has modified it over time, adding and removing words to keep things fresh.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                                        What makes Wordle different from other word games is the information structure. Each guess eliminates a specific set of candidates based on letter position and presence. A good player uses this information systematically rather than guessing randomly, and that systematic approach is exactly what the analyzer measures.

The analyzer scores these openers around 62-67% quality — meaning they eliminate roughly 60-70% of possible answers on the first guess alone.</p>

Instead, test 3-4 new letters to gather more elimination data. Only commit to building a word around your known greens when the candidate list drops below 20.</p>

The analyzer flags violations of this in hard mode. In normal mode, ignoring this rule wastes guesses — you already know the letter and its position, so testing it elsewhere provides zero new information.</p>

                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                        Most people use the analyzer out of curiosity, not desperation. They solve the daily puzzle on their own, then paste their game to see how they did compared to optimal play. The result is usually humbling — even experienced players regularly find that their guess 2 or 3 scored below 60% quality, meaning an alternative guess would have eliminated twice as many candidates.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                        Some players use it to settle arguments. "I should have guessed RAISE on turn 2, not ARISE" — the analyzer gives a definitive answer. Others use it to learn hard mode discipline. If you keep breaking hard mode rules without realizing it, the analyzer catches every violation.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                                        The honest use case: when you are on guess 5 with 6 candidates remaining and no clear way to distinguish them. The analyzer shows you which guess gives the most information, and sometimes that information is the difference between guessing correctly on turn 6 or running out of tries.

                                                <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm">Quordle gives you 9 guesses to solve four 5-letter words simultaneously. The strategy is completely different — you need a first guess that covers common letters across all four boards. The analyzer does not handle Quordle because the multi-board state creates different constraint interactions.</p>

Same feedback system (green/purple/black), but the search space has structural constraints — operators, equals signs, and arithmetic validity. A dedicated Nerdle solver handles these constraints; the Wordle analyzer cannot.</p>

                                                <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm">Semantle uses semantic similarity instead of letter positions. You guess words and get a numerical score showing how close they are in meaning to the answer. No green or yellow tiles — just a gradient from cold to hot. The strategies are completely different; Semantle rewards vocabulary breadth over letter pattern knowledge.</p>
